# i2b2files
This directory contains tab separated values (tsv) images of the i2b2 metadata tables.  It is generated by the following sequence:

```text
(venv)> cd i2FHIRb2/scripts
(venv)> generate_i2b2 --conf my_conf --od ../i2b2files
Loading fhir.ttl
loading w5.ttl
writing ../i2b2files/table_access.tsv (1) records written
writing ../i2b2files/concept_dimension.tsv (1999) records written
writing ../i2b2files/modifier_dimension.tsv (2794) records written
writing ../i2b2files/ontology.tsv (2004) records written
(venv)>
```
<small>(Note that the number of records written may change across versions and implementations)</small>

These files can be imported into the corresponding i2b2 tables if, for some reason, the direct `generate_i2b2` function does not work.
